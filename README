Project Name: MapReduce Words Organizer

Project Description: This project implements a MapReduce paradigm for text file
    processing. It processes text files to organize words by their first letter
    and outputs the results in separate files for each letter (a.txt, b.txt, ...,
    z.txt). The implementation uses pthread for parallel processing, with mapper
    and reducer threads coordinating to achieve efficient data organization.

Project Functionalities:
    1. MapReduce File Processing:

    - Implements the MapReduce paradigm with mapper threads to process text files
    and reducer threads to aggregate results..
    - Efficiently handles large datasets by splitting tasks among threads.

    2. Word Normalization:

    - Converts all words to lowercase.
    - Removes non-alphabetic characters to ensure uniformity.

    3. Word Grouping by First Letter:

    - Mapper threads groups words based on their starting letter.
    - Reducer threads consolidate results into separate output
    files (a.txt, b.txt, ..., z.txt).

    4. Thread Synchronization:

    - Ensures thread safety and coordination using mutexes and barriers.

    5. Custom Output Format:

    - Outputs words along with the file IDs where they appear.
    - Format: <word>:[<file_id1> <file_id2> ...].
